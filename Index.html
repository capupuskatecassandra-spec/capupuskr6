              <div><p>My Empowerment Technology experience as an ABM student has been both challenging and awarding. At firts, I thought the subject was only about using computers, but as the lessons went on I discovered that it was more about applying technology in practical and meaningful ways.<br> I learned how to use online platforms, create digital presentations, and design outputsnthat can be useful in business and academic purposes. These skills are important for me as an ABM student because technology is an big part of entrepreneurship,marketing, and communication. One of the best parts of my EmpTech Journey was having a good and handsome teacher who guided us with patience and understanding;). His way of teaching made the subject more engaging and less intimidating.<br> Because of his Encouragement, I was able to appreciate the importance of technology not only in schhol but also in real life applications.<br> This subject also taught me discipline, time management, and the value of being innovative. overall, my EmpTech experience, with the guidance of my teacher, helped me become a more responsible student and prepared me for the challenges of both business and life. <br>
